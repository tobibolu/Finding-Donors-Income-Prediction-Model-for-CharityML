# Fairness Report (Template)

## Why this matters
This model uses demographic and socioeconomic signals. Before deployment, review fairness metrics and legal/ethical constraints with stakeholders.

## Minimum checks
- Group-wise precision/recall by sex.
- Group-wise false positive / false negative rates.
- Data representativeness checks over time.

## Decision policy
- Define an escalation policy for unacceptable disparities.
- Define retraining and threshold-adjustment playbooks.
